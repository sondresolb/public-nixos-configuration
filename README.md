# NixOS System Configuration

My personal nixos configuration.


## Structure

The project is managed as a Flake. The Flake configuration consists of two files, the `./flake.nix`, specifying the inputs (dependencies) and outputs (artifacts/system configurations) of the Flake, and the `./flake.lock`, which pins every dependency and the Flake itself to a specific revision or digest, ensuring reproducibility. The outputs of the Flake are:

- `nixosConfigurations.laptop`
	
	The system configuration. The entire system configuration is defined in the file `nixos/configuration.nix` which also imports a hardware module `nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`. The hardware module is auto-generated by Nix when installing the NixOS operating system. The system configuration is mainly responsible for the components that are required to run a functional system. Any user specific software, dot-files, secrets, wallpapers, etc. should be managed by home-manager.

- `homeConfigurations.sondre@laptop`

   A stand-alone home-manager configuration. Everything that is user specific should be specified in the `home-manager/home.nix`.

## Building the system

After cloning this repository, you should change out the `nixos/hardware-configuration.nix` with your own generated file. If you have a new install of NixOS, you can copy the file located in `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`. If needed, you can recreate the hardware-configuration with the following command:

```bash
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```

We should now be ready to build the system for the first time. These commands are the same for every time we make a new change to the configuration files.

### Buildings the system configuration

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild --flake .#laptop
```
The `.` assumes that you are in the root folder of this repo. The `#laptop` select the system configuration to build. You could potentially have many system configurations for other machines or your phone.

### Building the user configuraion

If the `home-manager` command is not available, you will need to run `nix-shell -p home-manager`.

```bash
home-manager --flake .#sondre@laptop
```

This will make home-manager build the configuration for the user `sondre` on the host `laptop`. Here, you could potentially have many configurations for different users and hosts. This configuration contains a bash alias that makes it easier to rebuild the user config (`home-switch`) from any location.
